As a student at Ensign College learning DevOps and Kubernetes,
I want to integrate NetBox as a source of truth for server and network inventory,
so that I can gain hands-on experience with consistent, automated configuration and understand how to reduce errors when deploying and scaling Kubernetes nodes as part of my project for Ensign College.

- NetBox contains accurate records of all physical and virtual servers used for Kubernetes in the project.
- Kubernetes nodes can automatically reference NetBox for IP addresses, VLANs, and device roles.
- The project demonstrates practical learning outcomes for my coursework at Ensign College.
